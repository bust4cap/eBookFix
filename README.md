# eBookFix
Fixes forced two-page view comic/manga epub 3.0 ebooks to work with single-page view, depending on the orientation of the reading device


Some manga on the Kobo store only display in two-page view, no matter how you hold your tablet or phone (like the German versions of Dragon Ball or Berserk), this little programm attempts to fix those. Only works with drm free books (or books that have their drm removed).


USAGE:
Put all .epub ebooks that need to be fixed in the same folder as the executable and run it.




Build in and requires dotnet 6.0.
